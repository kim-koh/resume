    <h2>No disagreement allowed</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Barbie in the Nutcracker</h3>
    <p>A pure work of cinematography with classic Tchaikovsky soundtrack. Great hair and costuming.</p>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
    <p>Duh. I cried a whole lot.</p>

<h3>Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</h3>
    <p>This movie overall slaps. Lots of laughs, surpasses the language barrier. Family-friendly.</p>
